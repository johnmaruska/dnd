### Non-standard Terminology

##### Trait

Taken from Racial section but extrapolated out to be any named bonus which must
later be applied. Traits are separated into categories - applicable (static
increases), choosable (requires player input), and feature (typically declared
action, not a number or entry on character sheet).


##### Feature (Trait)

Not to be confused with Feat. A feature / feature trait is a trait which can be
exercised only under certain situations either as a reaction to a situation or
as declared by the player. Feats are as described in the book.
